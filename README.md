# Welcome to Yon's Portfolio

To view my Portfolio, please head to https://yonholmes.github.io/portfolio/

## What's it written in?:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) *"Bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app)"*.
  - I decided to use **Next.js** due to being a well favored tool in the industry. I am espically fond of its organised handling of routing.
- [MUI Core](https://mui.com/material-ui/) *an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design.*
  - I have been a long term fan of the MUI component library, and is a go-to for any project I work on.
- [React](https://react.dev/) In their words *"The library for web and native user interfaces"*
  - This technology was first mentioned to me a few years after 2014 at my first job (pre v1), and was becoming mainstream when I learn't it many years later.
